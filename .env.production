# Binance API - PRODUCTION
# ============================================
# ⚠️  CRITICAL: Use PRODUCTION API keys!
#
# Setup Steps:
# 1. Go to: https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/api-management
# 2. Create NEW API key specifically for production
# 3. Enable "Enable Futures" permission
# 4. Whitelist your server IP address
# 5. Enable "Spot & Margin Trading" if needed
# 6. DO NOT enable "Enable Withdrawals" (security)
#
# Security Recommendations:
# - Use separate API keys for each environment
# - Restrict IP to your server only
# - Start with low leverage (1x-5x)
# - Set daily withdrawal limit to 0
# - Enable 2FA on your Binance account
