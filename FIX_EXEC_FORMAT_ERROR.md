# 🔧 Fix "exec format error" Issue

## Problem

```
exec /server: exec format error
```

This means the Docker binary was compiled for the wrong CPU architecture (AMD64 instead of ARM64).

---

## ✅ Solution

I've fixed two things:

1. **Dockerfile** - Now auto-detects CPU architecture (ARM or AMD64)
2. **docker-compose.yml** - Removed nginx, removed obsolete version warning

---

## 📋 Steps to Fix on Your Server

### Step 1: Upload Fixed Files

**From your local machine:**

```bash
# Upload fixed Dockerfile
scp Dockerfile opc@YOUR_SERVER_IP:~/tradingAPI/

# Upload fixed docker-compose.yml
scp docker-compose.yml opc@YOUR_SERVER_IP:~/tradingAPI/
```

**Or if using rsync:**

```bash
rsync -avz Dockerfile docker-compose.yml opc@YOUR_SERVER_IP:~/tradingAPI/
```

### Step 2: Rebuild on Server

**SSH to your server:**

```bash
ssh opc@YOUR_SERVER_IP
cd ~/tradingAPI
```

**Clean up old containers and images:**

```bash
# Stop and remove old container
docker compose down

# Remove old images
docker rmi tradingapi-crypto-api
docker rmi $(docker images -f "dangling=true" -q)

# Clean build cache
docker builder prune -a -f
```

**Rebuild with correct architecture:**

```bash
# Rebuild from scratch
docker compose build --no-cache

# Start
docker compose up -d

# Check logs
docker compose logs -f
```

### Step 3: Verify It's Working

```bash
# Check container is running (not restarting)
docker compose ps
# Should show: STATUS "Up X seconds"

# Check logs for success messages
docker logs crypto-TradingAPI

# Should see:
# ✅ Firebase client initialized successfully
# ✅ Binance client initialized successfully
# 🚀 Server starting on port 8080
```

**Test the API:**

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Should return:
# {"status":"healthy","time":...}
```

## 🔍 What Was Changed

### Dockerfile (Line 21)

**Before:**
```dockerfile
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build \
```

**After:**
```dockerfile
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build \
```

**Why:** Removed hardcoded `GOARCH=amd64`. Now Docker automatically detects if your server is ARM64 or AMD64 and compiles accordingly.

### docker-compose.yml

**Changes:**
1. Removed `version: '3.8'` (obsolete, causes warning)
2. Removed entire nginx service (you have nginx on server already)
3. Removed healthcheck (not needed for simple setup)
4. Container name now matches your setup: `crypto-TradingAPI`

---

## 📊 Architecture Detection

Your server CPU architecture:

```bash
# Check what architecture you have
uname -m

# Possible outputs:
# x86_64  = AMD64 (Intel/AMD)
# aarch64 = ARM64 (Ampere A1)
```

Oracle Cloud Free Tier offers:
- **AMD64:** 2 VMs with 1GB RAM each
- **ARM64:** 1 VM with 24GB RAM (4 cores)

The new Dockerfile works with **BOTH**! 🎉

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If still getting "exec format error"

**1. Make sure you uploaded the NEW Dockerfile:**

```bash
# On server, check the Dockerfile
cat ~/tradingAPI/Dockerfile | grep "GOARCH"

# Should NOT see GOARCH (we removed it)
# If you still see "GOARCH=amd64", upload again
```

**2. Make sure you rebuilt from scratch:**

```bash
docker compose down
docker system prune -a -f
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

**3. Check your server architecture:**

```bash
uname -m
docker version | grep Arch
```

### If container keeps restarting

```bash
# Check logs for actual error
docker logs crypto-TradingAPI

# Common issues:
# - Missing .env file
# - Missing firebase credentials
# - Invalid API keys
```

### If port 8080 already in use

```bash
# Find what's using port 8080
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep 8080

# Or
sudo lsof -i :8080

# Kill the process or change PORT in .env
```

---

## ✅ Expected Result

After following these steps, you should see:

```bash
$ docker compose ps
NAME               IMAGE                   COMMAND     SERVICE      CREATED         STATUS         PORTS
crypto-TradingAPI  tradingapi-crypto-api   "/server"   crypto-api   10 seconds ago  Up 8 seconds   0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp

$ curl http://localhost:8080/health
{"status":"healthy","time":1760123456}
```

**No more "exec format error"!** ✅

## 📦 Files Changed

- ✅ `Dockerfile` - Fixed architecture detection
- ✅ `docker-compose.yml` - Removed nginx, removed version warning

**Upload both files to your server and rebuild.**

---

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

**Check these:**

1. **Uploaded correct files?**
   ```bash
   ls -lh ~/tradingAPI/Dockerfile
   ls -lh ~/tradingAPI/docker-compose.yml
   ```

2. **Rebuilt from scratch?**
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   docker system prune -a -f
   docker compose build --no-cache
   ```

3. **Environment variables set?**
   ```bash
   cat ~/tradingAPI/.env
   # Should have all required variables
   ```

4. **Firebase credentials exist?**
   ```bash
   ls -lh ~/tradingAPI/config/firebase-credentials.json
   ```

**After fixing, your API should start successfully!** 🚀
